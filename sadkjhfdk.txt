Path to create slide


ht_player calls 
        this.myActiveSlide = new ht4f_slide(slideno, jsondata.slides[slideno - 1], true);
		ht_slideClass assigns slideData to the jsondata[slideno]
		
		A foreach is done on slideData.media	(the media is from the json file - has tag, classLst, transition, volume if applicable, etc.)
		   look to see whether or not the last slide audio ended etc. Do I load new?, retain old?
		   The jsonMedia is sent to a wrapper class
					if (loadNewBkg === true) {
						let mNew = new ht4f_mediaClass(m);
						mNew.elem.currentTime = m.offsetTime;
						mNew.delay = 0;
						myDebugger.write(1, "Pushing new " + mNew.text);
						this.mediaArray.push(mNew);
					}
					if (m.duration !== SLIDE_DURATION_OFF)
						this.bgEnds = true;
		
		Later when the media search  (CheckFileExists) happens and media is found, 
		setsource(file) is called. Change this


ht_player: autoNext
		set MasterVolume
		stop autoTimer (this won't be needed with gsap)
		return if last slide
		if bg defined use it, if not defined, done
		
		
		
actions needed
const audioCtx = new AudioContext || webkit
const myaudio = document.querySelector("audio")		i.e. it is the DOM element

// Create a MediaElementAudioSourceNode
// Feed the HTMLMediaElement into it - now we deal with the SourceNode wrapper
const source = audioCtx.createMediaElementSource(myAudio);

// Connect the AudioBufferSourceNode to the gainNode
// and the gainNode to the destination, so we can play the
// music and adjust the volume using the mouse cursor
source.connect(gainNode);
gainNode.connect(audioCtx.destination);




Notes for future
   Prev and Next preload the slide data for the given slide
		when slide is being loaded, the complete slide timeline is created.
		then, all I have to do is wait for the timeline to finish
			when slide timeline finishes, the transition occurs. A negative delay should cause the transition to start before the slide is gone.
			when the transition is done, all "current" are removed and "next" are preloaded.
   GSAP must be made aware of the exact slide time
   Background image and audio
		need class of keep, preload, background
		tran-out : $('.keep.background')  means don't stop it or start it
		tran-out : $('.keep') not allowed because animation / audio needs to unload except for background
		tran-out : $('.fade-out.background') means decrease volume to 0 during transition
		tran-in  : $('fade-in'
